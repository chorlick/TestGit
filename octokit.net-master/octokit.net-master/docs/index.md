# Octokit.net

This is a place for putting together some introductory documentation about how to use Octokit.net.

Possible topics to cover:

 - Authentication 
 - Working with Repositories
 - Working with User data
 - Working with Git data
 - Searching Repositories
 - ...

If you're not sure where to start, there's a suite of 
[integration tests](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/tree/master/Octokit.Tests.Integration/Clients)
which can help you to get familiar with how things currently work.

Love and Octocats,
The Octokit.net Team
